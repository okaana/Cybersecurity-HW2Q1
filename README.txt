I have used the method of obfuscation (to use this method all u need to do is add a bunch of methods and expand the code in such a way that the malware scanners dont recognize what the actual intention of the code is)

To run the malware do the below

Just click the Project.exe and it will 

1. Add a PE-1.txt file if it does not exist and add the malware code (here the line "I want to learn PE file format!")
2. Edit the file if it exists
3. opens the content of file if it has malware line

Enjoy!!!
